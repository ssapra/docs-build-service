This topic describes how to install and configure Pivotal Build Service.

## <a id='install'></a> Install and Configure Pivotal Build Service

## Prerequisites

- PKS installed
- Kubectl installed locally (Only required if no ingress controller is already installed)
- Ruby (This is required to create the UAA client)
- An Ingress Controller has been installed on the cluster where Pivotal Build Service is going to be installed. The Pivotal Build Service expects an Ingress Controller and an Ingress Service to be running to configure it's own ingress. A example of an Ingress Controller Deployment can be found [here](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/how-to-set-up-an-ingress-controller-for-a-pks-cluster)
- Persistent Volumes have been configured on the cluster where Pivotal Build Service will be installed as it relies on Persistent Volume Claims to cache build artifacts to speed up subsequent builds. The cache size per image has been configured to 2GiBs


## Retrieve cluster credentials

This step retrieves the credentials used by `kubectl` to talk to the
PKS cluster where Pivotal Build Service will run

```bash
pks get-credentials <cluster-name>
```

To target the cluster execute

```bash
kubectl config use-context <cluster-name>
```

These commands only needs to be run once for the full installation.

## <a id='uaa-client-creation'></a> Install UAA Pivotal Build Service client

### Prerequisites
- Ruby

### Install the UAA client

The users of Pivotal Build Service are configured on a UAA.
In order to talk with UAA, Pivotal Build Service must have a client
configured. To configure this client we recommend using `uaac` tool

1) Install `uaac` tool on your machine, run the following command
  ```bash
  gem install cf-uaac
  ```

  **Note:** if not using `rbenv` or `rvm` you may need to execute `sudo gem install cf-uaac`

2) Target the UAA that will be used to authenticate the Build Service Users

  ```bash
  uaac target <UAA_URL>
  ```

  **Note:** When using a self-signed certificate, you must use the `--skip-ssl-validation` flag in conjuction with `uaac` 

3) Login as user management admin user

  ```bash
  uaac token client get admin -s <user-management-admin-user>
  ```
  
  **Note:** This password can be found in the UAA credentials section from Opsman.

4) Install the UAA Client

  ```bash
  uaac client add pivotal_build_service_cli --scope="openid" --secret="" --authorized_grant_types="password,refresh_token" --access_token_validity 600 --refresh_token_validity 21600
  ```
  
  **Note:** This command must be executed as is. The secret in this case **must** to be an empty string.

## Configure TLS certificates for Pivotal Build Service

You need to get or create TLS certificates for the Pivotal Build Service Domain that will be used in the [Install Pivotal Build Service step](#install-pivotal-build-service). These certificates may be self signed.

When you have the `.crt` and `.key` files, place them in `/tmp/certificate.crt` and `/tmp/certificate.key`

After installation the TLS certificates may be removed.

**NOTES (MacOS Only):** When using the `pb` cli, the CA certificate must be added to the keychain and the trust settings must be changed from `Use System Defaults` to `Always Trust`.


## Install Pivotal Build Service

1) Download the Duffle executable for you operating system from [Pivnet](https://network.pivotal.io/products/build-service/)

1) Download the Pivotal Build Service Bundle from [Pivnet](https://network.pivotal.io/products/build-service/)

1) Create a credentials file that maps the location where the credentials can be found.
   This file will be used by `duffle` during the installation

   Here is a template for the credentials file:
   ```yaml
   name: build-service-credentials
   credentials:
     - name: kube_config
       source:
         path: "<path to kubeconfig on local machine>"
       destination:
         path: "/root/.kube/config"
     - name: ca_cert
       source:
         path: "<path to CA certificate for registry access>"
       destination:
         path: "/cnab/app/cert/ca.crt"
     - name: "tls_cert"
       source:
         path: "<path to TLS certificate>"
       destination:
         path: "/cnab/app/cert/tls.crt"
     - name: "tls_key"
       source:
         path: "<path to TLS private key>"
       destination:
         path: "/cnab/app/cert/tls.key"
   ```

   This file should be created in `/tmp/credentials.yml` this location can be changed but
   the `duffle install` command must be updated accordingly

   **Note:** In the credentials file all the local paths need to be absolute.
    
1) Import the images bundle

    This step will extract the bundle
    ```bash
    duffle import /tmp/build-service-${version}.tgz -d /tmp/build-service/
    ```
1) Copy the images from the extracted bundle into an internal Image Registry

    Login to the Image Registry where the images will be stored
    ```bash
    docker login <SOME_IMAGE_REGISTRY>
    ```

    Push the images to the Image Registry
    ```bash
    duffle relocate -f /tmp/build-service-${version}.tgz -m /tmp/relocated.json -p <SOME_IMAGE_REGISTRY>
    ```

    ##### Optional: Setting custom Ingress controller annotations
    If you would like to use an ingress controller other than NGINX or you would like to pass additional annotations
    to your ingress controller, provide `duffle` with an additional JSON file during installation (ex. `duffle install -p /tmp/parameters.json` ...).

    ```json
    {
      "ingress_annotations": {
        "kubernetes.io/ingress.example-annotation-key": "example-annotation-value",
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

1) <a href="install-pivotal-build-service"></a>Install Pivotal Build Service
    
    ```bash
    duffle install <my-build-service-installation-name> -c /tmp/credentials.yml  \
        --set domain=<BUILD_SERVICE_DOMAIN> \
        --set kubernetes_env=<PKS_CLUSTER_NAME> \
        --set docker_registry=<DOCKER_REGISTRY> \
        --set registry_username="<REGISTRY_USERNAME>" \
        --set registry_password="<REGISTRY_PASSWORD>" \
        --set uaa_url=<UAA_URL> \
        -f /tmp/build-service/*/bundle.json \
        -m /tmp/relocated.json
    ```
    
    Variables information:
    
    - `my-build-service-installation-name` this is the unique name for the installation. 
    This name can be used after for upgrading Pivotal Build Service in the cluster `kubectl` is pointing at
    - `BUILD_SERVICE_DOMAIN` is the domain name that will be used to target Pivotal Build Service.
    This domain should have been configured as the domain for the Ingress controller.
    - `PKS_CLUSTER_NAME` Name of the PKS cluster where Pivotal Build Service will be installed
    - `DOCKER_REGISTRY` Domain of the Image Registry used in the previous step to push images to
    
      **Note:** if using dockerhub the domain should be `index.docker.io`
    - `REGISTRY_USERNAME` Username to access the registry
    - `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` Password to access the registry
    - `UAA_URL` URL to access UAA
    
    Additional optional properties: 
    - `disable_builder_polling` this will prevent the build service from polling builder images for buildpack updates
    This option requires you to set up a [Builder Webhook](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-build-service/blob/master/webhooks.md).
    This is a boolean value so it should be used like: `--disable_builder_polling=true`
    - `-p <JSON paramaters file>` this will set ingress annotations (see the "Optional: Setting custom Ingress controller annotations" step above)
    
    **Note** Some images will be pushed again to the image registry because during installation the CA Certificate provided
    will be added to the list of the available CA on these images. To do this, the duffle command must be provided
    with the credentials for the image registry

1) Verify installation

    Download `pb` binary from Pivnet
    
    Target Pivotal Build Service
    ```bash
    pb api <PIVOTAL_BUILD_SERVICE_DOMAIN>
    ```
    In case you have a UAA that has been signed by a self-signed CA, add the `--skip-ssl-validation` flag at the end of the `pb api` command
    
    A user should be created at this point, please follow the instructions in [here](#users-create)
    
    After creating a UAA user the next step should successfully log you in to Pivotal Build Service
    ```bash
    pb login
    ```
