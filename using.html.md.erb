This topic describes how to use Pivotal Build Service to manage images, projects, builds, builders, the stack, and the store.


## <a id='configure-cli'></a> Log Into Your Kubernetes Cluster

After you configure and install Build Service, you can use the `pb` CLI to interact with your Build Service installation.

For more information, see [Installing and Configuring Build Service](./installing.html).

To use your Build Service installation:

1. Log into your Kubernetes Cluster that has the Build Service installation using the CLI of your preferred managed Kubernetes service.
    <br/><br/>
    For example, if you are using PKS:

    ```
    pks login -a <PKS URL> -u <username> -p <password>

    pks get-kubeconfig <cluster> -a <PKS URL> -u <username> -p <password>
    ```

## <a id='manage-projects'></a> Manage Projects

The following procedures describe how to manage projects and project members with the `pb` CLI.

A `project` is a Build Service entity that provides user access control to images, image configurations, and image builders. For more information, see [Build Service Projects](./index.html#project-config).

#### <a id='create-project'></a> Create a Project

To create a new project:

    pb project create PROJECT-NAME

Where `PROJECT-NAME` is a unique name for the project.

#### <a id='create-project'></a> List Projects

To view projects of which the user is a member:

    pb project list

#### <a id='targeting-project'></a> Targeting a Project

Projects map to Kubernetes namespaces. Because of this, you should not create projects with the same name as pre-existing Kubernetes namespaces.

The user who creates the project is added to the project as its first member. Because of this, you cannot access resources produced by Build Service globally across all the namespaces in the cluster.

To target a project:

    pb project target PROJECT-NAME

Where `PROJECT-NAME` is the name of your project.

After you have targeted a project, Build Service assumes that the commands you run are for that project.

In order to target a different project, run the command again and specify a different project.

#### <a id='manage-project-members'></a> Add and Remove Project Members

Any member of a project can add and remove other project members.

#### <a id='add-users'></a> Add Users to a Project

To add users to a project:

1. Target your project.

1. Run:

    ```
    pb project user add USERNAME
    ```
    Where `USERNAME` is the username of the user you want to add.

#### <a id='remove-users'></a> Remove Users from a Project

To remove users from a project:

1. Target your project.

1. Run:

    ```
    pb project user remove USERNAME
    ```
    Where `USERNAME` is the username of the user you want to remove.

#### <a id='add-groups'></a> Add Groups to a Project

To add groups to a project:

1. Target your project.

1. Run:

    ```
    pb project group add GROUPNAME
    ```
    Where `GROUPNAME` is the name of the group you want to add.

#### <a id='remove-groups'></a> Remove Groups from a Project

To remove groups from a project:

1. Target your project.

1. Run:

    ```
    pb project group remove GROUPNAME
    ```
    Where `GROUPNAME` is the name of the group you want to remove.

#### <a id=‘list-members'></a> List members of a project

To list members of a project:

1. Target your project.

1. Run:

    ```
    pb project members 
    ```

#### <a id='manage-image-registries'></a> Manage Image Registries for a Project

For a project to use an image registry in Build Service, you must associate an image registry and the image registry credentials with the project. If the source code for the image is saved in a repository, you must also associate the Git credentials with the project.

Build Service uses these credentials to deliver container image builds to the specified registry.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The registry credentials must belong to a user with <code>write</code> access on the registry.</p>

Build Service supports the following image registries:

* Docker Hub
* GCR
* Harbor
* Artifactory

#### <a id='add-image'></a> Associate an Image Registry with a Project

To associate an image registry and image registry credentials with a project:

1. Target the project with which you want to associate the image by running:

    ```
    pb project target PROJECT-NAME
    ```
    Where `PROJECT-NAME` is the name of the project that owns the image.

1. Create a YAML file with the image registry location and credentials. Enter the following variables:

    ```
    registry: REGISTRY-DOMAIN
    username: REGISTRY-USERNAME
    password: REGISTRY-PASSWORD
    ```
    Where:
    * `REGISTRY-DOMAIN` is the domain for the registry. Use the following guidance to complete the `registry` field, depending on your image registry:
      * **Docker Hub**: Enter `index.docker.io`.
      * **GCR**: Enter `gcr.io`.
      * **Harbor**: Enter the domain that is specific to your deployment of the registry.
      * **Artifactory**: Enter the domain that is specific to your deployment of the registry
    * `REGISTRY-USERNAME` and `REGISTRY-PASSWORD` are the username and password of the image registry, respectively. You can include only one password for an image registry in the credentials YAML file.

1. Apply the image registry YAML file by running:

    ```
    pb secrets registry apply -f PATH-TO-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-YAML
    ```
    Where `PATH-TO-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-YAML` is the local path to the YAML file that you created in the previous step.

#### <a id='change-registry-association'></a> Change Image Registry Association and Credentials

To update the registry association and credentials for a project:

1. Modify the variables in your image registry YAML file.
    * To change the project the registry is associated with, modify `project`.
    * To change the registry associated with the project, modify `registry`.
    * To change the credentials for the registry, modify `username` and `password`.

1. Apply the image registry file by running:

    ```
    pb secrets registry apply -f PATH-TO-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-YAML
    ```
    Where `PATH-TO-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-YAML` is the local path to the YAML file that you created in the previous section.

#### <a id='manage-git-repos'></a> Manage Git Repositories for a Project

To allow Build Service to execute builds against app source code in a private Git repository, you must add the Git username and password to the project that manages the source code.

As you apply YAML files that associate a Git repository and Git repository credentials with a project, the `pb` CLI provides feedback indicating whether or not the commands succeeded.

#### <a id='add-git-credentials'></a> Associate a Git Repository with a Project

To associate a Git repository and Git repository credentials with a project:

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If your git repository uses an access token, you can specify the token in the below <code>password</code> field. For more information, see <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line">Creating a personal access token for the command line</a> in the GitHub documentation.</p>

1. Create a YAML file with the Git repository location and credentials. Enter the following variables:

    * If using username and password:
        ```
        repository: GIT-REPOSITORY
        username: GIT-USERNAME
        password: GIT-PASSWORD/TOKEN
        ```
        Where:
        * `GIT-REPOSITORY` is the URL of the GitHub repository.
        * `GIT-USERNAME` is the Git username used to access the GitHub repository.
        * `GIT-PASSWORD/TOKEN` is the password or access token used to access the GitHub repository.

    * If using ssh credentials:
        ```
        repository: GIT-REPOSITORY
        sshKey: SSH-KEY
        ```
        Where:
        * `GIT-REPOSITORY` is the URL of the GitHub repository.
        * `SSH-KEY` is the value of the ssh key needed to access the git repository

1. Apply the Git repository file to the project by running:

    ```
    pb secrets git apply -f PATH-TO-REPOSITORY-CREDENTIALS-YAML-FILE
    ```
    Where `PATH-TO-REPOSITORY-CREDENTIALS-YAML-FILE` is the local path to the YAML file that you created in the previous step.

#### <a id='change-repo-association'></a> Change Git Repository Association and Credentials

To update the Git repository and credentials for a project:

1. Modify the variables in your Git repository YAML file.
    * To change the Git repository associated with the project, modify `repository`.
    * To change the credentials for the Git repository, modify `username` and `password`.

1. Apply the Git repository credentials file by running:

    ```
    pb secrets git apply -f PATH-TO-REPOSITORY-CREDENTIALS-YAML-FILE
    ```
    Where `PATH-TO-REPOSITORY-CREDENTIALS-YAML-FILE` is the local path to the YAML file that you created in the previous step.

#### <a id='delete-git-creds'></a> Delete Git Repository Credentials from a Project

To delete Git credentials from a project:

1. Run:

    ```
    pb secrets git delete github.com
    ```

#### <a id='delete-project'></a> Delete a Project

This procedure describes how to delete a project using the `pb` CLI.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you delete a project, all registry credentials and Git secrets associated with that project are also deleted.</p>

To delete a project:

1. Delete all image configurations in Build Service that are owned by the project. You cannot delete a project if the project owns any images on Build Service. To delete image configurations, see [Delete an Image](#delete-images).

1. Run:

    ```
    pb project delete PROJECT-NAME
    ```
    Where `PROJECT-NAME` is the name of the project to delete.

## <a id='manage-store'></a> Manage the Store

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Only Build Service Admins can perform store commands./</p>

#### <a id='add-buildpackages-to-store'></a> Add Buildpackages to the Store

Users can add multiple buildpackages at a time from a Docker registry or the local machine:

* If using a Docker registry:

    ```
    pb store add <buildpackage-1> <buildpackage-2> ...
    ```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The user must have access to the Docker registry on the local machine.</p>

* If using ssh credentials:

    ```
    pb store add <buildpackage-1> <buildpackage-2> ...  --local
    ```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Documentation for creating buildpackages: https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/package-a-buildpack/</p>

#### <a id='remove-buildpackages-from-store'></a> Remove Buildpackages from the Store

Users can remove a buildpackage from the store:

    pb store remove <buildpackage>

#### <a id='list-buildpackages-in-store'></a> List Buildpackages in the Store

Users can list the buildpackages in the store:

    pb store list

Users can also list buildpackages and the buildpack order:

    pb store list --order

The output of this command is helpful because it mirrors the format used when creating custom builders .

## <a id='manage-stack'></a> Manage the Stack

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Only Build Service Admins can perform stack commands./</p>

#### <a id='update-stack'></a> Update the Stack

Users can update the stack using build and run images from a Docker registry or the local machine:

- If using a Docker registry:

    ```
    pb stack update -b <build image> -r <run-image>
    ```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The user must have access to the Docker registry on the local machine.</p>

* If using ssh credentials:

    ```
    pb stack update -b <build image> -r <run-image> --local
    ```

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, Build Service only supports the <strong>cflinuxfs3</strong> build and run images.</p>

#### <a id='get-stack-status'></a> Get Stack Status

Users can get the current status of the stack:

    pb stack status

The following is an example of the output for this command:

    Stack ID:    org.cloudfoundry.stacks.cflinuxfs3
    Run Image:   cloudfoundry/run:full-cnb
    Build Image: cloudfoundry/build:full-cnb

## <a id='manage-builders'></a> Manage Builders

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Only Build Service Admins can manage Cluster scoped builders./</p>

#### <a id='builder-configurations'></a> Builder Configurations

To create a builder, you must create a builder configuration YAML that includes the following properties:

* `name`: The name of the builder.

* `tag`: The registry location where the builder will be created.

* `scope`: Defines whether the builder is available to the all users in the cluster or to users of the currently targeted project. One of 'Cluster' or 'Project'.

* `order`: The buildpack order that the builder will use.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Build Service must have the appropriate credentials to push to `tag`. Build Service has access to the registry used at install time and any secrets attached to the current project.</p>

#### <a id='apply-builder-configurations'></a> Apply Builder Configurations

To apply a builder configuration to Build Service:

1. Create a builder configuration YAML file. For example:

    ```
    name: foo
    tag: REGISTRY-DOMAIN/PATH-TO-NEW-BUILDER
    scope: Project OR Cluster
    order:
    - group:
      -  id: org.cloudfoundry.node-engine
      -  id: org.cloudfoundry.npm
    ```

1. Apply the builder configuration by running:

    ```
    pb builder apply -f PATH-TO-BUILDER-CONFIGURATION
    ```
    Where `PATH-TO-BUILDER-CONFIGURATION` is the local path where you saved the builder configuration YAML file.

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> When the `scope` is `Project` the builder will be applied to the currently targeted project.</p>

#### <a id='delete-builder'></a> Delete a Builder

To delete a builder:

* Delete a cluster scoped builder:

    ```
    pb builder delete <builder name> --cluster
    ```

* Delete a project scoped builder:

    ```
    pb builder delete <builder name>
    ```

<p class='note'><strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting a builder will prevent image configs that reference that builder from successfully building again.</p>

#### <a id='get-builder-details'></a> Get Builder Details

To get builder details:

* Details for a cluster scoped builder:

    ```
    pb builder get <builder name> --cluster
    ```

* Details for a project scoped builder:

    ```
    pb builder get <builder name>
    ```

#### <a id='list-builders'></a> List Builders

To list all builders available to the current user:

    pb builder list

#### <a id='get-builder-status'></a> Get Builder Status

To get the current builder status:

* Status for a cluster scoped builder:

    ```
    pb builder status <builder name> --cluster
    ```

* Status for a project scoped builder:

    ```
    pb builder status <builder name>
    ```

## <a id='manage-images'></a> Manage Images

The following procedures describe how to create and manage images in Build Service.

#### <a id='create-image'></a> Image Configurations

To create an image, you must create an image configuration YAML that includes the following properties:

* `source`: Defines the Git location of the code that the image is built against. The `revision` can be either a `branch`, `tag` or a commit `sha`. When you target the image against a branch, Build Service triggers a build for every new commit.

* `build`: Defines additional configuration for your app such as buildpack version numbers.
  - Includes an `env` property that supplies values to the build by setting environment variables.
  - Each `env` environment variable is an object with a `name` and a `value`, for example `BP_JAVA_VERSION` and `8.*`.

* `image`: Defines the destination registry of the builds for the image. You must specify the credentials for the target registry in the `registries` section of the project configuration. For more information, see [Manage Image Registries for a Project](#manage-image-registries). The value for `image` must match the domain of one of the registries that you provided in the project configuration. Build Service uses the value of `image.tag` to refer to the image after it is created. If you update the image `tag`, Build Service creates a new image.

For more information about creating and applying image configurations for apps with source code in GitHub or source code saved locally, see [Apply Image Configurations](#apply-image).

#### <a id='apply-image'></a> Apply Image Configurations

Build Service supports builds against apps with source code that is saved in a Git repository or saved on your local machine. You can specify only one location for app source code.

The procedures in this section describe how to apply image configurations in Build Service that have source code saved in a Git repository or source code saved locally.

#### <a id='apply-image-with-git-repo'></a> Apply an Image With Source Code in a Git Repository

To apply an image configuration to Build Service:

1. Create an image configuration YAML file. For example:

    ```
    source:
      git:
        url: https://github.com/PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP
        revision: master
    build:
      env:
      - name: ENV-NAME
        value: ENV-VALUE
    image:
      tag: REGISTRY-DOMAIN/PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP-IMAGE
    ```

    Where:
      * `PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP` is the path to an app on GitHub.
      * `ENV-NAME` is the name of your build environment.
      * `ENV-VALUE` is the value of your build environment.
      * `REGISTRY-DOMAIN` is the domain for the registry. Use the following guidance to complete the `registry` field, depending on your image registry:
        * **Docker Hub**: Enter `index.docker.io`.
        * **GCR**: Enter `gcr.io`.
        * **Harbor**: Enter the domain that is specific to your deployment of the registry.
        * **Artifactory**: Enter the domain that is specific to your deployment of the registry
      * `PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP-IMAGE` is the local path to the image registry.

1. Apply the image configuration by running:

    ```
    pb image apply -f PATH-TO-IMAGE-CONFIGURATION
    ```
    Where `PATH-TO-IMAGE-CONFIGURATION` is the local path where you saved the image configuration YAML file.

#### <a id='apply-image-with-local-source-code'></a> Apply an Image With Local Source Code

Users can apply source code from a directory, compressed source code (`zip`, `tar.gz`, `.tar`), or a `.jar` file.

To apply an image configuration that uses local source code:

1. Create an image configuration file that has no Git properties. For example:

    ```
    build:
      env:
      - name: ENV-NAME
        value: ENV-VALUE
    image:
      tag: REGISTRY-DOMAIN/PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP
    ```
    Where:
    * `PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP` is the local path to an app.
    * `ENV-NAME` is the name of your build environment.
    * `ENV-VALUE` is the value of your build environment.
    * `REGISTRY-DOMAIN` is the domain for the registry. Use the following guidance to complete the `registry` field, depending on your image registry:
      * **Docker Hub**: Enter `index.docker.io`.
      * **GCR**: Enter `gcr.io`.
      * **Harbor**: Enter the domain that is specific to your deployment of the registry.
      * **Artifactory**: Enter the domain that is specific to your deployment of the registry

1. Apply the image configuration by running:

    ```
    pb image apply -f /PATH-TO-IMAGE-CONFIGURATION/IMAGE-CONFIGURATION.yaml -p /PATH-TO-APP-DIRECTORY
    ```
    Where:
    * `PATH-TO-IMAGE-CONFIGURATION` is the local path to the image configuration YAML file.
    * `IMAGE-CONFIGURATION` is the name of the image configuration YAML file.
    * `PATH-TO-APP-DIRECTORY` is the local path to the app directory.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> To use this feature, the user must have access to the Docker registry specified by the `tag` property on the local machine.</p>

#### <a id='apply-image-by-referencing-blob-store-source'></a> Apply an Image With Source Code In A Blob Store

To apply an image and reference source code that lives in a blobstore:

1. Create an image configuration file that has no Git properties. For example:

    ```
    build:
      source:
        blob:
          url: https://storage.blob.com/my-org/myapp.jar
      env:
      - name: ENV-NAME
        value: ENV-VALUE
    image:
      tag: REGISTRY-DOMAIN/PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP
    ```
    Where:
    * `PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP` is the local path to an app.
    * `ENV-NAME` is the name of your build environment.
    * `ENV-VALUE` is the value of your build environment.
    * `REGISTRY-DOMAIN` is the domain for the registry. Use the following guidance to complete the `registry` field, depending on your image registry:
      * **Docker Hub**: Enter `index.docker.io`.
      * **GCR**: Enter `gcr.io`.
      * **Harbor**: Enter the domain that is specific to your deployment of the registry.
      * **Artifactory**: Enter the domain that is specific to your deployment of the registry

1. Apply the image configuration by running:

    ```
    pb image apply -f /PATH-TO-IMAGE-CONFIGURATION/IMAGE-CONFIGURATION.yaml
    ```
    Where:
    * `PATH-TO-IMAGE-CONFIGURATION` is the local path to the image configuration YAML file.
    * `IMAGE-CONFIGURATION` is the name of the image configuration YAML file.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Build Service v0.0.4 does not support polling functionality for source code that is stored in a blobstore. When you push new source code to the specified blobstore URL, Build Service cannot rebuild your app.</p>

#### <a id='apply-image-with-custom-builder'></a> Apply an Image With A Custom Builder

Users can use any of the <a href="list-builders">available builders</a> with any of the source types (git, blob, or local).

To apply an image and reference a custom builder:

1. Create an image configuration file that has builder properties:

    ```
    build:
      source:
        git:
          url: https://github.com/PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP
          revision: master
    builder:
      name: BUILDER-NAME
      scope: Project OR Cluster
    image:
      tag: REGISTRY-DOMAIN/PATH-TO-EXAMPLE-APP
    ```

1. Apply the image configuration by running:

    ```
    pb image apply -f /PATH-TO-IMAGE-CONFIGURATION/IMAGE-CONFIGURATION.yaml
    ```
    Where:
    * `PATH-TO-IMAGE-CONFIGURATION` is the local path to the image configuration YAML file.
    * `IMAGE-CONFIGURATION` is the name of the image configuration YAML file.

#### <a id='list-images'></a> List Images

To list all the image configurations for the currently targeted project:

1. Run:

    ```
    pb image list
    ```

The following is an example of the output for this command:

```
Project: some-project

Images
------
first/image:tag
second/image:tag
third/image:tag
```

#### <a id='rebuild-image'></a> Image Rebuilds

Rebuilds happen in three ways. An imperative rebuild occurs when you make edits to the image configuration and run `pb image apply`. An automatic rebuild occurs when build inputs change, without you editing the image configuration itself. Finally, a user can trigger a rebuild manually.

You can initiate an imperative rebuild in these ways:

* You update the commit, branch, Git repository, or build fields on the image's configuration file and re-apply it by running `pb image apply`.

* You upload a new copy of the local source code by running `pb image apply -p PATH-TO-SOURCE`, where `PATH-TO-SOURCE` is the source code path.

For more information, see [Apply Image Configurations](#apply-image).

Build Service auto-rebuilds images when one or more of the following build inputs change:

* New buildpack versions are made available through an updated builder image.
    - The Build Service Bundle on Pivotal Network includes the latest buildpacks contained in a builder image.
    - When upgrading PBS, you must relocate new buildpack versions over to your container registry.

* There is a new commit on a branch or tag Build Service is tracking.

* There is a new base OS image available, such as `cflinuxfs3`.

You can initiate a manual rebuild using `pb`:

    pb image trigger IMAGE-TAG

This is useful for debugging image builds.

#### <a id='monitor-builds'></a> Monitor Builds for an Image

The procedures in this section describe how to view information and logs for image builds.

Build Service stores the ten most recent successful builds and the ten most recent failed builds.

To view logs for a build, you must provide the build number. You cannot view logs for a build by referencing the image digest.

#### <a id='view-all-builds'></a> View All Builds for an Image

To list all the builds created for an image:

1. Run:

    ```
    pb image builds IMAGE-TAG
    ```
    Where `IMAGE-TAG` is the value of the field `image.tag` in the image configuration YAML file.

The following is an example of the output for this command:

```
Build    Status    Started Time           Finished Time          Reason    Digest
-----    ------    ------------           -------------          ------    ------
    1    SUCCESS   2019-09-09 21:55:27    2019-07-08 21:55:54    CONFIG    *************************************************
    2    SUCCESS   2019-09-09 21:56:55    2019-07-08 21:57:40    COMMIT    *************************************************
    3    SUCCESS   2019-09-09 21:57:55    2019-07-08 21:58:40    STACK     *************************************************
    4    FAILED    2019-09-09 21:58:55    2019-07-08 21:59:40    CONFIG+   --
    5    BUILDING  2019-09-09 21:59:55    --                     BUILDER   --
    -    PENDING   --                     --                     UNKNOWN   --
```

The following describes the fields in the example output:

* `Build`: Describes the index of builds in the order that they were built.

* `Status`: Describes the status of a previous or pending build image.

* `Started Time`: Describes when a build started.

* `Finished Time`: Describes when a build finished.

* `Reason`: Describes why an image rebuild occured. These reasons include:
    * `CONFIG`: Occurs when a change is made to commit, branch, Git repository, or build fields on the image's configuration file and you run `pb image apply`.
    * `COMMIT`: Occurs when new source code is committed to a branch or tag build service is monitoring for changes.
    * `BUILDER`: Occurs when new buildpack versions are made available through an updated builder image.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> A rebuild can occur for more than one reason. When there are multiple reasons for a rebuild, the <code>pb</code> CLI output shows the primary <code>Reason</code> and appends a <code>+</code> sign to the <code>Reason</code> field. The priority rank for the <code>Reason</code>, from highest to lowest, is <code>CONFIG</code>, <code>COMMIT</code>, and <code>BUILDER</code>.</p>
    * `STACK`: Occurs when a new base OS image, called a `run image`, is available.

* `Digest`: Contains the `SHA256` of the successfully built image. You can reference this SHA to run Docker commands such as `pull` and `inspect`.

#### <a id='view-build-details'></a> View the status of a image Config

When a user creates an image using the above workflow, they are also creating an image configuration against which a stream of images will be built.

1. If a particular build associated with an image fails, check the status of the image by running :

    ```
    pb image status IMAGE-TAG 
    ```

    Where:
    * `IMAGE-TAG` is the value of the `image.tag` field in the image configuration YAML file.

The following is an example output of this command

```
Image
-----
Status:          NOT READY
Message:         N/A
Latest Image:    gcr.io/myapp@sha256:9d7b1fbf7f5cb0f8efe797f30e598b5e38bb1c08ada143d4c96e4f78111a9239

Last Successful Build
---------------------
ID:        1
Reason:    CONFIG

Last Failed Build
-----------------
ID:        2
Reason:    COMMIT
```

#### <a id='view-build-details'></a> View Build Details for an Image

To display retrieve a detailed Bill of Materials for a particular build:

1. Run:

    ```
    pb image build IMAGE-TAG -b BUILD-NUMBER
    ```
    Where:
    * `IMAGE-TAG` is the value of the `image.tag` field in the image configuration YAML file.
    * `BUILD-NUMBER` is the number of the build you want to inspect.

The following is an example of the output for this command:

```

```

The following describes the fields in the example output:

* `Status`: Describes the status of a previous or pending build image.

* `Reason`: Describes why an image rebuild occured. These reasons include:
    * `CONFIG`: Occurs when a change is made to commit, branch, Git repository, or build fields on the image's configuration file and you run `pb image apply`.
    * `COMMIT`: Occurs when new source code is committed to a branch or tag build service is monitoring for changes.
    * `BUILDER`: Occurs when new buildpack versions are made available through an updated builder image.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> A rebuild can occur for more than one reason. When there are multiple reasons for a rebuild, the <code>pb</code> CLI output shows the primary <code>Reason</code> and appends a <code>+</code> sign to the <code>Reason</code> field. The priority rank for the <code>Reason</code>, from highest to lowest, is <code>CONFIG</code>, <code>COMMIT</code>, and <code>BUILDER</code>.</p>
    * `STACK`: Occurs when a new base OS image (called a `run image`) is available.

* `Image`: The full image tag for the app image produced by the build.

* `Run Image`: The full image tag for the run image used by the app.

* `Builder`: The full image tag for the builder image used by the build.

* `Source`: This field contains one of the following:
    * For a build created from a Git commit:
        * `Git`: The Git repository URL.
        * `Revision`: The commit SHA.
    * For a build created from local source code:
        * `Local Source`: Indicates that the source code was pushed from a development workstation.
    * For a build created from a blob:
        * `Blob`: The blob URL.

* `Buildpacks`: A list of buildpacks the build used.

#### <a id='view-build-logs'></a> View Logs for a Build

To view logs for a build:

1. Run:

    ```
    pb image logs IMAGE-TAG -b BUILD-NUMBER
    ```
    Where:
    * `IMAGE-TAG` is the value of the `image.tag` field in the image configuration YAML file.
    * `BUILD-NUMBER` is the number of the build with the logs you want to view.

The following is an example of the output of the command:

#### <a id='view-running-build-logs'></a> View Logs for a Running Build

You can stream logs that show the progress of a build. The logs terminate when the build completes.

To view logs for a running build:

1. Run:

    ```
    pb image logs IMAGE-TAG -b BUILD-NUMBER -f
    ```
    Where:
    * `IMAGE-TAG` is the value of the `image.tag` field in the image configuration YAML file.
    * `BUILD-NUMBER` is the number of the build with the logs you want to view.

#### <a id='delete-images'></a> Delete an Image

This procedure describes how to delete a Build Service image.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting an image also deletes all the builds that the image owns. It does not delete the images generated by those builds.</p>

To delete an image:

1. Run:

    ```
    pb image delete IMAGE-TAG
    ```
    Where `IMAGE-TAG` is the value of the `image.tag` field in the image configuration YAML file.

When you successfully delete an image, you see this message:

```
Successfully deleted image IMAGE-TAG
```
